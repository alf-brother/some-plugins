This few scripts can be used to create a small feature to get the time you 
spend on modifying files. The opening and closing time is written to a 
sqlite3 database to save the periods the files where modified.

By adding the to scripts (timeadd.sh and timeaddclose.sh) to the opening or
closing event of your editor (in this example for vim) you can quit easy read
the used time with the timeusd.sh.

I added all the files into a hidden folder called .time on my home. After that
you can add the following three lines to your .vimrc to implement the time 
visualisation feature to your system.

autocmd BufReadPre * silent !~/.time/timeadd.sh %
autocmd BufNewFile * silent !~/.time/timeadd.sh %
autocmd QuitPre * silent !~/.time/timeaddclose.sh %

With ~/.time/timeused.sh FILENAME you get the time used to modify the file.
